Mersenne Twister Random Number Generator Add-In extension provides 
spreadsheet functions generates pseud-random number with 
Mersenne Twister algorithm. 
And an UNO component which generates random number accessible from 
macro.

The generator is based on C++ implementation written by Richard J. Wagner. <br />
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wagnerr/MersenneTwister.html

This extension is working just a wrapper for it. If you need to know 
the implementation of the generator and the extension, read the source code 
of them, they are provided openly.


== Spreadsheet Functions ==
These functions are provided on spreadsheets as add-in functions. 
They can be found in the Mathematical category.

You can choose seed for the functions, see the following section.

=== MTRAND ===
 =MTRAND()
Generates pseud-random number between 0 to 1 in [0,1). 
This result is one of 32-bit random numbers.

=== MTRANDBETWEEN ===
 =MTRANDBETWEEN(Bottom;Top)
Generates pseud-random integer number between Bottom to Top in [Bottom,Top].


== Choose A Seed ==
Open Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org Calc - MT Random page to 
set initialization mode. Following modes can be choosed.

You can set these options throught Tools - Extension Manager dialog.

=== Automatically ===
This is default mode. If this mode is selected, a seed for 
initialization is automatically selected from /dev/urandom or time() and clock().

=== Single unsigned integer ===
A seed is specified by an unsigned integer which is inputted in the 
numeric field, which range is between 0 to 2^32 -1.

=== Array of unsigned integer ===
If you want to use larger value as a seed, choose this mode. 
The following description is taken from original code.

Seed the generator with an array of uint32's 
There are 2^19937-1 possible initial states.  This function allows 
all of those to be accessed by providing at least 19937 bits (with a 
default seed length of N = 624 uint32's).  Any bits above the lower 32 
in each element are discarded.

== About Speed ==
Internal implementation of the original generator is much fast. 
But there is a problem between to call add-in functions, which 
makes dramatically speed downed. They are called through 
com.sun.star.beans.XIntrospection interface which needs many 
function calls makes speed down. 
Apparently implementation of add-in functions are not suite 
for spreadsheet functions.

Please vote to the following issue to swich random number generator to 
Mersenne Twister based one.
